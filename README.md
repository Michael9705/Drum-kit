# Drum-kit description:

This is an application simulates a drum kit. By looping through button-classes that contain different drums, various sound files are linked to unique button by adding eventListeners throught DOM manipulations.<br>

EventListeners are triggered by either cliking buttons or pressing keys that associate to buttons. Key animation is also implemented to give a visual notice when events are triggered.
